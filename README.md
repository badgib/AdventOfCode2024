## ADVENT OF CODE 2024 ##

It's just my small repo to keep track of the tasks. It shall be updated with a one day delay not to encourage cheating. I know that the code could be more optimised and generally done more pythonic way but it is what it is and it works. I try to comment up the code and make it readable so struggling people can maybe learn a thing or two.

### DAY ONE ###

We got a two-column list of integers that needed to be parsed. First task required some sorting and comparing the sorted values row by row. The resulting differences then needed to just be all added up and that was the answer. Second task required to compare every value from column one to every value in column two to see how many times it occurs in there. To get the correct answer the initial value needed to be multiplied by the number of occurences and summed up with all other values to get a correct answer.
