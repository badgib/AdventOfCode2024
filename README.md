## ADVENT OF CODE 2024 ##

It's just my small repo to keep track of the tasks. It shall be updated with a one day delay not to encourage cheating. I know that the code could be more optimised and generally done more pythonic way but it is what it is and it works. I try to comment up the code and make it readable so struggling people can maybe learn a thing or two.

### DAY ONE ###

We got a two-column list of integers that needed to be parsed. First task required some sorting and comparing the sorted values row by row. The resulting differences then needed to just be all added up and that was the answer. Second task required to compare every value from column one to every value in column two to see how many times it occurs in there. To get the correct answer the initial value needed to be multiplied by the number of occurences and summed up with all other values to get a correct answer.

### DAY TWO ###

This time we will work on a bunch of ingeters in every line. We have to figure out if the numbers are within ±1 to ±3 and only increasing or decreasing but only in one 'direction'. Second task needed us to find out if the lines could adhere to previous rules if we could remove one of the numbers per line. Answers were both a number of found valid lines.

### DAY THREE ###

Today the first task was very straightforward (if you know regex) and required a very simple findall over the lines for certain pattern. A bit of simple multiplication and adding up the results and it's done. Second problem took me a while to understand where I made a mistake - forgot an edge-case of `don't\(\)` that has no `do\(\)` and instead it just ended on EOL. So a simple regex tweaking and it's done. A couple lines of code.

### DAY FOUR ###

Day four went pretty smoothly... for the first part, just had to make a matrix from the lines and go around and search for strings to show up in all the directions. Or one of them, rather. But yeah. That was fairly easy. The X MAS one with the two MAS making an X was a bit less trivial but still not that terribly different from first problem.
